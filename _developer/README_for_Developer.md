Steps to add new game
---
1) Make video of few seconds of game. See section below "How I created the GIF animations" for this.
2) Create thumbnail picture for the game in preferred size of 350x350 pixels and place it in folder `assets/images`. You will recognize the filename pattern when you look at the existings assets.
3) Add new line starting with `<div class="imageBox"` to `index.html` file. Modify the values for video, picture and description appropriately.
4) That's it.
